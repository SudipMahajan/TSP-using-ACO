# TSP-using-ACO
This repository contains sequential python implementation of Ant Colony Optimization algorithm to solve travelling Salesman Problem
The detailed algorithm is presented in the book "Nature-Inspired Metaheuristic Algorithms" 2nd edition by Xin-She Yang.

The interested reader is encouraged to have a look at the original algorithm presented in Appendix A of the paper:
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/585892

The code is divided into two files "acofront.py" and "acoback.py"
"acofront.py" implements the algorithm whose functions are defined in "acoback.py"

Code is created and maintained by
